**********************
Identifiers / Variables
***********************
Rules :

Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. 
Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore. 
They cannot start with a digit. 
Variable names are case-sensitive
Reserved keywords in Java (e.g., int, class, if, for) cannot be used as variable names.
Variable names cannot contain spaces.


Conventions : 
Variable names should start with a lowercase letter.
 If the name consists of multiple words, 
 the convention is to use camelCase, 
 where the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized (e.g., myVariableName).
 
 While allowed, it is not recommended to start variable names with a dollar sign or underscore.
